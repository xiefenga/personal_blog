This post demonstrates how to add images to your blog posts. You can use header images for social sharing, inline images for content, and set Open Graph images for better link previews.

## Header/Open Graph Images

The `image` field in your frontmatter sets the Open Graph image for social media previews. When someone shares your post on Twitter, LinkedIn, or Slack, this image appears in the preview card.

```yaml

title: "Your Post Title"
image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1499750310107-5fef28a66643?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop"
---
```

**Recommended dimensions:** 1200x630 pixels (1.91:1 ratio)

## Inline Images

Add images anywhere in your markdown content using standard syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text description](/images/screenshot.png)
```

Here's an example image from Unsplash:

The alt text appears as a caption below the image.

## Image Sources

You can use images from:

| Source      | Example                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Local files | `/images/my-image.png`            |
| Unsplash    | `https://images.unsplash.com/...` |
| Cloudinary  | `https://res.cloudinary.com/...`  |
| Any CDN     | Full URL to image                 |

### Local Images

Place image files in the `public/images/` directory:

```
public/
  images/
    screenshot.png
    diagram.svg
    photo.jpg
```

Reference them with a leading slash:

```markdown
![Screenshot](/images/screenshot.png)
```

### External Images

Use the full URL for images hosted elsewhere:

```markdown
![Photo](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1461749280684-dccba630e2f6?w=800)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive alt text** for accessibility
2. **Optimize image size** before uploading (compress PNG/JPG)
3. **Use CDN URLs** for external images when possible
4. **Match OG image dimensions** to 1200x630 for social previews
5. **Use SVG** for logos and icons
